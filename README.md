### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For my final project I developed an inventory management app. The goal of this app is to provide a tool that buisness owners could use to keep track of their products.  my application required a dynamic table that could easily add, update, and create item rows. Additonally each item needed to keep track of item quantity. A quantity counter where users could hit a button to increase or decrease the quantity was needed.Additionally when an items quantity reached zero it would then send a text message to the user, if they allowed messaging in settings.   

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The application would include three screens, a login screen, a table screen, and a text message acceptance screen. My users were buisness owners who owned a large inventory. For my appliaction I would not need vibrant flashy graphics. My goal for the UI was to stay proffessional and easy to use. I achived this by using a simple color pallet and only using color to highlight important features such as buttons and titles. Looking back I think I did a good job at following these guidlines and as a result created a professional application.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When coding the application I coded features in the order a user would see them. I first started with the login page. The login page needed to be the first screen to appear and take inputs of a username and password. If the credentials were correct it would take the user to the inventory page. On this page I developed the dynamic table first and then the buttons for controlling quantity. Finally I worked on the messaging portion of the application. Looking back I think I made the right choice on order of completion. That being said, I could see it being more convenient to work on the main functionallity and then implement features such as login page.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

For testing I used the Android Studio phone emulator. This was a new and really cool feature that Android Studio provides to run/test applications. For my assignment I did manual testing on all of the features. Looking back this could have been optomized with automation but for such a small project I think this was an ok decision. It is improtant to test your applications thuroughly to avoid small bugs turning into big problems. Thurough testing will ensure you produce quality products and save your time and money.

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

During this course I found that the most challenging process came from development of the project. I am not a strong developer so coding the application took me longer than most, but I am presistant and used plenty of YouTube tutorials to produce an application that I am proud of.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I am particularly proud of my dynamic table. The table dynamically creates rows which can each be customized with name and quantity values.
