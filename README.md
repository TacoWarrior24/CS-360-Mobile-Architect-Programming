### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For my final project I developed an inventory management app. The goal of this app is to provide a tool that buisness owners could use to keep track of their products.  my application required a dynamic table that could easily add, update, and create item rows. Additonally each item needed to keep track of item quantity. A quantity counter where users could hit a button to increase or decrease the quantity was needed.Additionally when an items quantity reached zero it would then send a text message to the user, if they allowed messaging in settings.   

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
